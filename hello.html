<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>My name is Aldo Madrid. I am a student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. I am in Prof C’s ISTM 209 class, section 599. I need to write eight sentences on each of the two paragraphs on my welcome page. The content of the paragraphs isn’t really important because this assignment is about learning HTML thankfully. I also need to provide four links to external websites, so this is a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>. This is a link to <a href="https://lynda.tamu.edu/">Lynda</a>. This is a link to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph. I already wrote eight sentences in the first paragraph, now it is paragraph two’s turn. I also already included four links to external websites. This is sentence number four; I think the website speaks for itself. I have three sentences to go after this current one. Now I need two more sentences. Now I need one more sentence to finish paragraph two. This is the eighth sentence!</p>
