<p>This is my webpage. I am currently a senior technology management major at <a href="http://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&M University</a>. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas and plan on living there after I graduate. Some of my hobbies include mountain biking, learning about different models of cars, building PCâ€™s, and playing PC games. I am also a tech nerd so I have the latest and greatest out now including the newest <a href=http://www.apple.com/watch>Apple Watch</a>, the iPhone X coming soon, and the <a href=https://www.oculus.com/en-us/>Oculus Rift</a> coming in the near future just to name a few.</p>
<p>My website contains some pictures of things I like and places I've been as well as other things I enjoy. Thanks for looking!
