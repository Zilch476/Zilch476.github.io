<h3>Howdy!</h3>
<p>
My name is Benjamin Cervantes and welcome to my website. These webpages were created to help my future employers better understand my values and character. 
I am a 21-year-old junior, attends <a href="http://eahr.tamu.edu/degrees-and-programs/undergraduate-degree-programs/technology-management">Texas A&M University</a>. 
My current major is Technology Management. I was raised by my mom in <a href="http://dallascityhall.com/Pages/default.aspx">Dallas, Tx</a>.
I hope to have a future career in <a href="http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=7">Information Technology</a>. I always enjoyed solving complex problem.
I believe that most problems have multiple solution.
</p>
<p>
To be good at a task one has to find be able to find the most efficient way to solve a problem. I understand that most things in life are hard. 
This is the reason why put in effort in everything I do. So that one day my mother can retire from her current job. Make her feel proud of me. 
This is why I joined the <a href="http://www.goarmy.com/rotc/ways-to-attend.html">Army ROTC program</a>. When I graduate from college, I should be commissioned into the Army as a second Lieutenant.
I hope that you have a better understanding of my goals in life.
