Throughout my life I've acquired many interests, hobbies, goals, and images of myself. I'm interested in computer hardware, adventures outside my city, anime, different cultures, and shoes. My hobbies are watching anime and movies (except horror), DIY projects, volleyball, eating delicious food, listening to any type of music, shopping, and spending time with my family and friends. My goals as of now are to graduate with a job ready in place, travel at least once to twice a year after one year of saving, and to make my family proud of me. In the past, my image was an athlete. Then it changed to be a computer engineer because my mother was one. Now my image is to work for a professional company in the IT deapartment. In the future, I imagine myself being a manager over ten to twenty people in the IT department.

Since I've been in college, I have met so many people and made so many memories. I'm in three organizations: Student Bonfire, Carter G. Woodson Black Awareness Committee (WBAC), and Aggies United. I voluteer in The Big Event and as a mentor in the Aggie Familia/AFAM program. Overall this is just a breif summary of me that scratches the surface of my life. Below I have a table that have a few of my favorite music artists, sport teams, and TV shows.
